Ting. Take two.

This project started as the Practicum project for the first year at MSIT. Given the problems that we ran into during the coding, we decided to give the project another go.

So here it is. Ting. The second try.

**Planned functionality:**
1. Virtual piano functionality.
2. Time adjustment between notes.
3. Translation to musical notes.
